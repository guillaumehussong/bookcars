# Google Places Autocomplete Integration Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for replacing the current location-based search system with Google Places Autocomplete. The new system will allow users to search for cars based on proximity to coordinates rather than predefined locations in the database.

## Phase 1: Setup & Infrastructure

### ~~Task 1.1: Google Maps API Setup~~
- ~~Register/configure Google Cloud Platform project~~
- ~~Enable required APIs (Places API, Maps JavaScript API, Geocoding API)~~
- ~~Create API key with appropriate restrictions (HTTP referrers, IP addresses)~~
- ~~Add API key to frontend environment variables (env.config.ts)~~

### ~~Task 1.2: Create Reusable Google Autocomplete Component~~
- ~~Create new component `GooglePlacesAutocomplete.tsx`~~
- ~~Implement input field with Google Places Autocomplete integration~~
- ~~Add event listeners for place selection~~
- ~~Implement proper type definitions for Google Places API responses~~
- ~~Include configuration options (types filtering, bounds restriction)~~
- ~~Add error handling for API failures~~

### ~~Task 1.3: Create Location Utilities~~
- ~~Create `LocationUtils.ts` for shared functionality~~
- ~~Implement coordinate distance calculation functions~~
- ~~Implement address formatting utilities~~
- ~~Create functions to convert between different coordinate formats if needed~~

## Phase 2: Frontend Implementation

### ~~Task 2.1: Modify Search Form Component~~
- ~~Replace `LocationSelectList` with `GooglePlacesAutocomplete` in `SearchForm.tsx`~~
- ~~Update state management to store place details (coordinates, address text)~~
- ~~Maintain compatibility with existing form validation~~
- ~~Add visual feedback for location selection~~
- ~~Ensure responsive design for mobile devices~~

### ~~Task 2.2: Create Location Refinement Modal~~
- ~~Create new component `LocationRefinementModal.tsx`~~
- ~~Implement Google Map with draggable marker~~
- ~~Add address display with coordinate information~~
- ~~Include confirmation button to select refined location~~
- ~~Ensure responsive design for mobile compatibility~~
- ~~Add loading states and error handling~~

### ~~Task 2.3: Update Search Form State Management~~
- ~~Modify state to store location coordinates instead of location IDs~~
- ~~Update form validation to accommodate new data structure~~
- ~~Create compatibility layer for existing location-based workflows~~
- ~~Ensure proper state reset when form is cleared~~
- ~~Add coordinate validation functions~~

### ~~Task 2.4: Update Search Form Submission~~
- ~~Modify `handleSubmit` function to include coordinates in search parameters~~
- ~~Update navigation state to include coordinate data~~
- ~~Create fallback for cases where coordinates aren't available~~
- ~~Add telemetry to track success rates of coordinate-based searches~~
- ~~Ensure backward compatibility for existing search flows~~

## Phase 3: Backend API Updates

### Task 3.1: Create Coordinate-Based Search Endpoint
- Create new endpoint `/api/cars/search-by-coordinates`
- Implement parameter validation for coordinate data
- Design response format to include distance information
- Add documentation for new endpoint
- Implement rate limiting and other security measures

### Task 3.2: Implement Geospatial Query Functionality
- Update Car model to ensure proper indexing of location coordinates
- Implement MongoDB geospatial queries for proximity search
- Add configurable search radius parameter
- Optimize query performance with appropriate indexes
- Implement sorting by distance

### Task 3.3: Add Distance Calculation Capabilities
- Implement server-side distance calculation between search point and car locations
- Add distance field to car search results
- Implement sorting by distance
- Create configuration options for distance units (km/miles)
- Add distance filtering capabilities

## Phase 4: Search Results Integration

### Task 4.1: Update Search Page for Coordinate-Based Results
- Modify `Search.tsx` to process coordinate parameters
- Add display of search location (address) in results header
- Update map component to show search location marker
- Update URL structure to include coordinate parameters
- Ensure backward compatibility with location ID-based searches

### Task 4.2: Enhance Result Display
- Add distance information to each car result card
- Implement sorting controls for distance-based sorting
- Update filtering UI to include distance filter
- Enhance map view to show radius circles
- Add visual indicators for proximity

### Task 4.3: Implement Sorting and Filtering by Distance
- Add distance-based sorting option to sort controls
- Implement client-side distance filtering
- Update filter state management to include distance parameters
- Add distance filter UI controls
- Ensure filter state persistence

## Phase 5: Testing & Optimization

### Task 5.1: Test Search Accuracy
- Create test plan covering various location scenarios
- Implement automated tests for coordinate-based search
- Test edge cases (international locations, remote areas)
- Verify distance calculations against known values
- Test performance with large result sets

### Task 5.2: Optimize Query Performance
- Profile query execution times for coordinate searches
- Implement database indexing optimizations
- Add caching for frequent searches
- Implement pagination optimizations
- Reduce payload size for mobile networks

### Task 5.3: Implement UI Optimizations
- Add progressive loading for search results
- Optimize map rendering for mobile devices
- Reduce input latency in autocomplete component
- Implement debouncing for autocomplete requests
- Add visual feedback for long-running operations

### Task 5.4: Cross-Browser and Device Testing
- Test on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Test on mobile devices (iOS, Android)
- Test with various connection speeds
- Verify accessibility compliance
- Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation

## Phase 6: Deployment & Monitoring

### Task 6.1: Feature Flag Implementation
- Create feature flag system for gradual rollout
- Implement A/B testing capabilities
- Add ability to fall back to original search system
- Create admin controls for feature flags
- Implement monitoring for feature flag status

### Task 6.2: Monitoring Setup
- Add performance metrics for new search flow
- Implement error tracking for coordinate-based searches
- Create dashboard for search performance metrics
- Set up alerts for degraded performance
- Add user satisfaction tracking

### Task 6.3: Documentation and Training
- Update user documentation with new search capabilities
- Create internal documentation for system architecture
- Add code comments and API documentation
- Create training materials for support team
- Update FAQ with new search-related questions

### Task 6.4: Iterative Improvements
